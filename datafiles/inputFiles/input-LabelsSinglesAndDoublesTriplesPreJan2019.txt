% where we match these single and double terms OCCUR TOGETHER in a sentence 
% will be matched as one string so space between label is okay eg space between draft and pep [draft,draft pep] is okay,
% but make sure ther is comma between label and single or double terms

% this can be done automatically by extarcting all nouns and verbs from all message subjects, removing stopwords
