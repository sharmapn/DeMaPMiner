% Main labels input file 07 oct 2017. 
% modified added chunk load of more triples - 
% Notes - How this file is structured
% States with more information and therefore more priority are first. Eg, bdfl_accepted pep has more information than pep_accepted. Done because a sentence may capture both and we
% want that label with more information
% Also the file follows the same pattern as how a pep is proposed, reviewed, and accepted or rejected, final/implemented
% This makes file easier to understand, maintain and search
% Start with Triples and doubles are therefore at the end of file

% _ = and , 
% further to this, one underscore means the terms must be adjacent, pep_number to prevents cases pep has very large number - which would still match
% while two underscores mean terms matched but can allow other terms in between
% - = or
% in cases of two verbs in clause - ("PEP 488", "is", "marked as accepted")
% can extend this to include all states in one line, pep is was accepted rejected
% really important for making sure somne terms exist together and after another, especially bdfl pronouncement

% Reason triples right at the end

% Additional states - may be important
