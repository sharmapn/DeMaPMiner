% Main labels input file 02 aug 2017.
% Notes - How this file is structured
% States with more information and therefore more priority are first. Eg, bdfl_accepted pep has more information than pep_accepted. Done because a sentence may capture both and we
% want that label with more information
% Also the file follows the same pattern as how a pep is proposed, reviewed, and accepted or rejected, final/implemented
% This makes file easier to understand, maintain and search
% Start with Triples and doubles are therefore at the end of file

% _ = and
% - = or
% in cases of two verbs in clause - ("PEP 488", "is", "marked as accepted")
% can extend this to include all states in one line, pep is was accepted rejected
% really important for making sure somne terms exist together and after another, especially bdfl pronouncement

% Additional states - may be important
previous_version_rejected previous_version_pep rejected
% acceptance_deferred acceptance_of_pep deferred
deferred acceptance_of_pep deferred
