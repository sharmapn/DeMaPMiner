PEP 215 | proposal | support | To address that problem and a number of other concerns , this PEP proposes an alternative approach to compiler supported interpolation , based on a new interpolate magic method , and using a substitution syntax inspired by that used in string.Template and ES6 JavaScript , rather than adding a 4th substitution variable syntax to Python . | The suggested new string prefix is i '' rather than f '' , with the intended mnemonics being either interpolated string '' or il8n string '' os.system f echo LCB user message RCB '' This kind of code is superficially elegant , but poses a significant problem if the interpolated value user message is in fact provided by a user it 's an opening for a form of code injection attack , where the supplied user data has not been properly escaped before being passed to the os.system call . | 
PEP 215 | null | support | What Alexander proposes and I support is not to do string interpolation , but to simply change the syntax because the ' ' is redundant it 's a much smaller change | PEP 215 does not do what I want . |

PEP 272 | null | discussion | There was a bunch of subsequent discussion on Python crypto that led up to the current proposal , and that seems to have done a better job . | In fact , I do n't think any module implementing PEP 272 has ever been written , and the interface it describes is n't that great , so I would n't call the PEP process a big success where block ciphers are concerned . | That 's reasonable for modules written in Python , but I do n't subscribe to that idea for modules written in C.

PEP 292 | proposal | support | To address that problem and a number of other concerns , this PEP proposes an alternative approach to compiler supported interpolation , based on a new interpolate magic method , and using a substitution syntax inspired by that used in string.Template and ES6 JavaScript , rather than adding a 4th substitution variable syntax to Python . | The suggested new string prefix is i '' rather than f '' , with the intended mnemonics being either interpolated string '' or il8n string '' os.system f echo LCB user message RCB '' This kind of code is superficially elegant , but poses a significant problem if the interpolated value user message is in fact provided by a user it 's an opening for a form of code injection attack , where the supplied user data has not been properly escaped before being passed to the os.system call . |

PEP 498 | proposal | support | To address that problem and a number of other concerns , this PEP proposes an alternative approach to compiler supported interpolation , based on a new interpolate magic method , and using a substitution syntax inspired by that used in string.Template and ES6 JavaScript , rather than adding a 4th substitution variable syntax to Python . | The suggested new string prefix is i '' rather than f '' , with the intended mnemonics being either interpolated string '' or il8n string '' os.system f echo LCB user message RCB '' This kind of code is superficially elegant , but poses a significant problem if the interpolated value user message is in fact provided by a user it 's an opening for a form of code injection attack , where the supplied user data has not been properly escaped before being passed to the os.system call . |

PEP 212 | deferred | discussion | Based on recent discussions with the BDFL and the Python 2.0 release manager , this PEP is deferred until Python 2.1 . | It is assigned to Peter Schneider Kamp . | Some minor editorial and formating modifications were performed on the text supplied by Peter .
PEP 215 | proposal | support | To address that problem and a number of other concerns , this PEP proposes an alternative approach to compiler supported interpolation , based on a new interpolate magic method , and using a substitution syntax inspired by that used in string.Template and ES6 JavaScript , rather than adding a 4th substitution variable syntax to Python . | The suggested new string prefix is i '' rather than f '' , with the intended mnemonics being either interpolated string '' or il8n string '' os.system f echo LCB user message RCB '' This kind of code is superficially elegant , but poses a significant problem if the interpolated value user message is in fact provided by a user it 's an opening for a form of code injection attack , where the supplied user data has not been properly escaped before being passed to the os.system call . | 
PEP 215 | null | support | What Alexander proposes and I support is not to do string interpolation , but to simply change the syntax because the ' ' is redundant it 's a much smaller change | PEP 215 does not do what I want . |

PEP 238 | null | support | The wrongness does n't come out immediately , and you can argue about it so in a sense it is a religious point but I am not a cultural relativist , and I find the proposed new semantics better than the old ones otherwise I would never have supported the PEP . | They are very subtly wrong , just as C 's int division semantics are subtly wrong they give a less useful result for negative numbers . |

PEP 256 | proposal | consensus | This PEP proposes a generic Docstring Processing System DPS framework , which separates out the components program and conceptual , enabling the resolution of individual issues either through consensus one solution or through divergence many . | The issues surrounding docstring processing have been contentious and difficult to resolve . | 
PEP 263 | updated | discussion | So after discussion with MAL , I have updated the PEP to reflect this strategy . | Still , providing the transitional warning of phase 1 is desirable , and indeed possible with this implementation . | There are only minimal user visible changes     more encodings can be supported even in phase 1 , in particular those based on ISO 2022    provided that the proper codecs are available  )    it is now an error if the declared encoding and the text do not match .
PEP 263 | proposal | discussion | In the discussion of PEP 263 , I proposed that the external encoding of Python scripts themselves be fixed as UTF 8 , and other encodings would have to be pretranslated by an appropriate codec . | I think it would be reasonable to make UTF 8 the default encoding on all platforms , except for internal OS functions , where Windows will presumably continue to use UTF 16 and nix distros will probably continue to agree to disagree about whether on disk format is NFD or NFC and the Python language as yet does n't know about NFC v. NFD , although the library does . | That was shouted down by the European contingent , who wanted to continue using Latin 1 and Latin 2 without codecs or a wrapper to call them transparently .

PEP 272 | null | discussion | There was a bunch of subsequent discussion on Python crypto that led up to the current proposal , and that seems to have done a better job . | In fact , I do n't think any module implementing PEP 272 has ever been written , and the interface it describes is n't that great , so I would n't call the PEP process a big success where block ciphers are concerned . | That 's reasonable for modules written in Python , but I do n't subscribe to that idea for modules written in C. I ca n't expect the users to have C compilers , and I do n't have the dev tools to compile binaries of the module for every platform people might want to use it on .
PEP 276 | null | discussion | The recent discussions around PEP 276 suggests that some people like the idea of a Haskell esque syntax whereby one specifies a list of numbers using a closed interval notation that includes a starting number , a secondary number that helps to establish the step size , an ellipsis style notation , and an ending number or variants on the above . | As PEP 276 notes , there appears to be interest in the Python community for inventing new syntax or other mechanisms that makes it easier and more natural to specify a list of numbers for clarity of indexed for loop based algorithms and other scenarios . | 
PEP 276 | null | majority | The majority of disagreement with PEP 276 came from those who favor much larger changes to Python to address the more general problem of specifying a sequence of integers where such a specification is general enough to handle the starting value , ending value , and stepping value of the sequence and also addresses variations of open , closed , and half open half closed integer intervals . | for item in sequence print sequence.index item |

PEP 292 | proposal | support | To address that problem and a number of other concerns , this PEP proposes an alternative approach to compiler supported interpolation , based on a new interpolate magic method , and using a substitution syntax inspired by that used in string.Template and ES6 JavaScript , rather than adding a 4th substitution variable syntax to Python . | The suggested new string prefix is i '' rather than f '' , with the intended mnemonics being either interpolated string '' or il8n string '' os.system f echo LCB user message RCB '' This kind of code is superficially elegant , but poses a significant problem if the interpolated value user message is in fact provided by a user it 's an opening for a form of code injection attack , where the supplied user data has not been properly escaped before being passed to the os.system call . |

PEP 422 | null | discussion | I actually had this idea a week or so ago , but packaging discussions and moving meant I had postponed writing it up and posting it . | I prefer the approach of adding the namespace '' argument to PEP 422 , though , since it makes init class a far more powerful and compelling idea , and between them the two ideas should cover every metaclass use case that only customises creation rather than ongoing behaviour . | Cheers , Nick .

PEP 470 | proposal | support | PEP 470 proposes to make some small enhancements to the multiple index support in order to allow subsequent deprecation and removal of the complicated and largely redundant link spidering system . | pip 's own existing multiple index support is what makes devpi and its concept not only of private indexes , but also separate dev , staging and production indexes , possible . | users can easily host custom repos on Launchpad  )  have proved enormously popular , and Fedora has now adopted a similar model with it 's COPR RPM building and yum repo hosting service .
PEP 470 | proposal | support | This PEP proposes that the official means of having an installer locate and find package files which are hosted externally to PyPI become the use of multi index support instead of the practice of using external links on the simple installer API . | Abstract | It is important to remember that this is   not   about forcing anyone to host their files on PyPI .

PEP 470 | proposal | support | I 've put forward a PEP that proposes a way to resolve the problems with reliability and implicitness of the current method of not hosting PyPI with centralizing around the multiple index URL support . | That being said , nobody is trying to mandate that everyone must upload to PyPI . | There are changes to PyPI in that proposal to increase the discover ability of the additional indexes however I ultimately think that it is the right path forward which brings PyPI inline with what the vast bulk of people    authors and users  )  expect but still preserves the ability for people who do n't want to , to not host on PyPI as well as reduce the number of ways that users have to be aware of for things not being hosted on PyPI .

PEP 498 | proposal | support | This PEP agrees with the basic motivation of PEP 498 , but proposes to focus both the syntax and the implementation on the il8n use case , drawing on the previous proposals in PEP 292 which added string.Template and its predecessor PEP 215 which proposed syntactic support , rather than a runtime string manipulation based approach . | txt 1,5 1,5 PEP 501 Title Translation ready string interpolation Title General purpose string interpolation Version Revision Last Modified Date Author Nick Coghlan ncoghlan at gmail.com 18,53 18,83 operation full access to containing namespaces as with any other expression , rather than being limited to explicitly name references . | 
PEP 498 | proposal | support | To address that problem and a number of other concerns , this PEP proposes an alternative approach to compiler supported interpolation , based on a new interpolate magic method , and using a substitution syntax inspired by that used in string.Template and ES6 JavaScript , rather than adding a 4th substitution variable syntax to Python . | The suggested new string prefix is i '' rather than f '' , with the intended mnemonics being either interpolated string '' or il8n string '' os.system f echo LCB user message RCB '' This kind of code is superficially elegant , but poses a significant problem if the interpolated value user message is in fact provided by a user it 's an opening for a form of code injection attack , where the supplied user data has not been properly escaped before being passed to the os.system call . |
