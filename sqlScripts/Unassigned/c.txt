That would be difficult, given that there are now two leading
contenders (if <cond>: x else: y vs. <cond> ?? x || y).  Given that both
have only emerged in the last day or so, there's been no time to
evaluate which is ahead.  I propose to let the discussion simmer another
week or so before voting.

Right, but the only effect of that on the examples is that they both  
need an 'else None' continuation or thereabouts.

I also predict widespread over-use of the new toy and agree with Jim  
that mandatory parentheses around the whole (X if Y else Z) construct  
would ameliorate legibility a bit.
