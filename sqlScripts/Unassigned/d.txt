Alas, it didn't to Python's parser -- one-token lookahead isn't enough to
distinguish
and Python won't grow anything a simple parser can't sort out.

Everything's cool if parens are required around a conditional expression,
though, in which case:
Seems a mixed bag, but I'm more interested in readability and the
functionality than in minimizing keystrokes; requiring parens doesn't hurt
the goals I care about.
